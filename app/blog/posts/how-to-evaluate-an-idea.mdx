## The tarpit

The first question you have to ask is painful: Is this a "tarpit" idea?
These are ideas that look simple on the surface, have broad appeal, but have killed every startup that touched them (think: "discovery" apps for events or music).

Unless a significant technology change has occurred recently, or a new regulation has passed, ask yourself why this doesn't exist yet.
If the answer is "nobody thought of it," you are wrong. They thought of it, tried it, and failed.

Look for the shift.
Is there a new wave to ride?
Is this a simple "X for Y"? (e.g., Cursor for screenplays).
If nothing has changed in the environment, you are probably walking into a trap.

## The user behavior

Does your idea involve changing human behavior?
If yes, stop.
Changing how people act is the hardest thing in the world. You want to surf existing behaviors, not try to be the tide.

And while you are looking at users, be honest: Is this an urgent problem?
Ask yourself: Who wants this right now?
Who wants this so much they will use a broken, ugly, barely functional v1 made by a two-person team they have never heard of?

If you can’t answer that, you don't have a startup. You have a side project.

## The competition

Don't be afraid of competition.
In fact, a market with zero competitors usually means there is zero money.
Look at Fintech—it's crowded because every successful company there makes a boatload of money. That is a good space.

If you enter a crowded market, you just need to offer something significantly better in one specific vector.
Dropbox didn’t win because they were the first to do cloud storage. They won because they integrated into the OS file system rather than forcing you to open a browser to upload a file.

However, watch out for the Gatekeeper.
Is there a platform (Apple, Google, OpenAI) that can kill your entire business with a single feature update? If yes, you are building on rented land.

## The feedback trap

When you talk to users, remember: they do not care about you.
They don't care about your pedigree, your past exits, or your vision. They only care if you can solve their pain.

And beware of polite users.
If people say "That's nice" and don't use it, your product is dead.
You actually want users who complain.
A user complaining that "It doesn't do X!" is a user who is trying to use it.
Politeness is the enemy of product-market fit.

Also, ignore "industry experts" who don't actually use the tools. Talk to the people in the trenches doing the work.
Ask them about their **problems**, not your **solutions**. It is your job to come up with the solution.

## The grind

Do not pick an idea just because it seems "fun."
No idea remains fun after 6 months.
After the honeymoon phase, you will be waking up every morning to fix bugs and handle support tickets.
If the problem itself doesn't obsess you, you will quit when the fun stops.

## The hardware warning

A specific note for hardware: Do not do crowdfunding on your first iteration.
If you have to ship parts from China, do it quietly at least a couple of times first.
If you crowdfund and screw up the logistics (which you will), it is a "one-shot kill." No VC will touch you, and you will be harassed for years by people who lost $50.

## The market reality

Finally, look at who you are selling to.
Are you trying to sell software to 80-year-olds who hate changing their routine? Good luck.
Selling to startups is always easiest. They are used to broken software and move fast.

And please, bury the "Build a network first, then charge" idea.
That is a horrible idea for 99% of founders.
Charge from day one. It filters out the noise.

It really comes down to this:
Find a problem so bad that people are begging for a solution, even if that solution is currently a buggy script you wrote last night.
Everything else is just vanity.
